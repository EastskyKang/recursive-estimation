# Extended Kalman Filter for Tracking a Three-Wheeled Robot
## Estimator Design Part 2

A root-mean squared(RMS) tracking error was defined to compare the performance of the estimator depending on the process noise variance Q_v (as used in the estimator).

It can be seen in Hist.pdf, the mean and the variance of the RMS tracking error is the smallest when Qv=0.1. As the process noise in the simulator(real environment) is 0.1, this shows that the tracking error is the smallest and less noisy when the process noise of the estimator model considered is accurate to the simulator(real environment). This is counter intuitive as considering a more conservative process noise does not result in a more accurate estimation. 

The optimality of Kalman Filter comes from the assumption that noise distribution is Gaussian and accurately known. As the random variables are gaussian random variables, it can be seen as a problem minmizing a quadratic cost. The estimated state and variance is calculated so that it is maximizing the posteriori likelihood. However, if we consider a Q_v which is a mismatch with the environment, the estimated value is not optimal.[1] Thus, considering an inaccurate process noise from the environment results in a less accurate estimation and increasing RMS tracking error. Moreover, the estimator tracks in a unreliable fashion result in a increase of variance of RMS tracking error.
